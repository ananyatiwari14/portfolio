        <h2> <mark> Climatic changes and its impact on farmers in Uttarakhand </mark> </h2>
        <section id = "break5">
          <p> On a stark January morning this year, Vijay Kothari, 24, paced up and down the courtyard, as his wife washed dishes using water from a large rainwater harvesting tank and his mother Buddhi Devi, his mother, played his infant daughter. The Kotharis, a farming family at Ghunogi village at Tehri, Uttarakhand, own various farm holdings which cut into the soft Himalayan mountainside. Beyond the courtyard where the family congregated was one such terrace farm: and it was infested with gnarly scrub brush and lay barren, akin to other terrace farms in the region.</p>
          <p> Buddhi Devi, who, like her husband had a browned, lined, weather-beaten complexion, said, “The time for sowing of winter crops, such as wheat, is over. Now, we wait for the rains in the summer months. Not just that, at times our crops get destroyed due to hail and excessive rainfall before summer too,” Vijay’s wife added that they were running out of water in the rainwater harvesting tank. Water unavailability was making life hard for the small family, and the lack of infrastructure development such as good roads and schools, added to their isolation. “There is nothing here,” Buddhi Devi added. It was a common refrain repeated throughout the village.</p>
          <p> At Ajay Das’s household a little higher up on the same mountainside, he is the only young man in a large family of sisters and his wife and mother, and his toddler children. He said he had a degree but no work. They too have a rainwater harvesting tank in their smaller household, but like others, it too was out of water by January. “There is immense issue of water here,” Das said. It should’ve also snowed or rained in the last few weeks, which would’ve helped the tanks fill up. But the skies had been sky-blue and clear throughout. The women of the household said that they walked 2-3 kilometers to get a few containers of water at a time. And even at that nearest hand-pump, water tends to run out in the summer months, adding to their stress. Bishna Devi, his mother, said that ideally it takes two hours to get the water, but if that dries out, they need to walk to other handpumps farther away. Over 90% of the state depends on natural springs for their water.</p>
          <p> Even though the state is home to various Himalayan glaciers which are the source for the major northern Indian river systems, and the mountainside is lush with greenery and forests, major climatic changes such as the rise in temperatures and the melting of glaciers have impacted the region drastically. The International Center for Integrated Mountain Development in its 2019 report said that even if global warming gets limited to 1.5 degrees, in the western Himalayas it will likely be still 0.3 to 0.7 degrees higher. And experts have forecasted frightening trends: that with every degree of warming, yields decrease by 10%, that avalanches, river flooding and wildfires would increase, and crop failures would become more rampant.</p>
          <p> The Himalayan population too has grown 250% from 1961 and is now over 50 million, and simultaneously, as per a Niti Aayog report of 2018, climate change has drastically dried up the springs. As the glaciers and the rivers, along with the western disturbances and the Indian ocean dipole, together constitute the complex weather system of the Himalayas (with El Nino and La Nina’s impacts also felt), the drying up of the springs is not the only alarming issue. There are various studies which confirm that snowfall is also declining in various regions.</p>
          <p> Less snowfall also results is less glacier formation due to crystallization of various layers. And adding to that is the glacial melt that has exacerbated due to global warming. Like a vicious cycle, the melting has increased, so it has impact on two ways – less snowfall and increase of temperature, said Dr Suraj Mal, who is a scientist and teaches at the University of Delhi, and studied the rainfall and snowfall in the region.   “If you talk to layperson in the hills – they will see that the snow season has shifted. Earlier they used to have snow in December, but this year – December and January and February were dry. Then suddenly, there were two weeks of snow in March,” said Mal.</p>
          <p> “Snow cover has been affected and found that that if this level of warming goes on, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand could completely lose snow cover by 2100,” said Dr Debangshu Banerjee, Graduate Research Fellow at Faculty of Science, University of Manitoba, who used NASA MODIS satellites and data to study the region’s snowfall and rainfall patterns over time. It’s not just a matter of glaciers melting; unpredictability of the rainfall and snowfall cycles is now the new norm. “The total amount of precipitation is also declining, and extreme events are more frequent,” he said. And the changes have impacted rainfall patterns in the winter and summer months which contribute to the kharif (summer) and rabi (winter) cropping seasons.</p>
          <p> Mal added that the rainfall and precipitation is interlinked with the weather changes and temperature rise. “Water availability is bad especially in months of May and June. Glaciers will experience enhanced melting this year. Number of days when temp will be high will be many more. Forest fires will increase in times to come because of moisture unavailability and dry forest in green monsoon season,” he said.</p>

          <p> The village of Kotharis are alike other villages of the region in that they used to sow wheat in the winters, with the help of the moisture from the snow. But this year, as weeks and months passed by without even a drop of rain or snow, the families had no choice but to simply leave the fields uncropped. It is thus no wonder that over the years, the production of wheat from the Tehri region has been extremely erratic.</p>
          <p> Adding to their misery is the human-wildlife conflict which has increased in the past few years. In the same village, Sulochna Kothari, 37, said that normally, by January, the family would’ve sowed enough wheat to sustain them for a year. But now, those fields lie barren. Other women showed pictures of them working in the fields next to a thin stream, planting rice in the summer. But animals destroy their crops, she said, and this has increased in the past five years or so. And rains had become unpredictable. “How will we grow crops? There are monkeys, wild boars that destroy them. It used to rain and snow by now, essential for wheat,” Sulochna said. </p>
          <p> Summers are now harsh also because the streams in the village dry up or lessen in volume, forcing her or other women to walk farther down or up in search for water. As per the Niti Aayog report of 2018, over 50 percent of the springs in the Himalayas have already dried up.  It is hard, she said. Though her husband earns money as a daily wage laborer, her two sons (her daughters are married) are now working in cities, and Sulochna and her husband and mother-in-law live on their remittances. </p>
          <p> The entire village is either habituated by the elderly or middle-aged people or the toddlers, and the youth have fled for greener pastures. The children of Sulochna, and Buddhi Devi no longer live in the villages. They work in Delhi, or in the tourism industry, and have no plans to return. And as agriculture is abandoned, and the younger generation moves out, the leftover forest land may seem like a win for environmental purposes. But such abandoned land is often degraded, and does not lead to healthy forest ecosystems, said experts. </p>
          <p> In 2021, an activist Hemant Gaunia filed an RTI  and revealed that out of over 6000 villages, over 300000 people have moved out permanently to search for better livelihood opportunities. The outflow of people is so high, that it has left behind over 3900 near- empty villages and over 700 ‘ghost’ villages. The highest number of people migrated out of Tehri at over 89,000 followed by Pauri, Alma, Chamoli and others. </p>
          <p> The out-migration of people can be attributed to lifestyle changes and a demand for better jobs in the cities but are also due to climate change, said SP Singh, an ecologist working for ATI. It has prompted an alarm amongst the environmentalists. What will happen to all that abandoned agricultural land? Will the cities of Uttarakhand, already congested, be capable to taking in so many new people? </p>
          <p> “There is no focus on development of services in the mountains, and with climate change, things are already uncertain,” said SP Singh. Agricultural productivity may have also decreased over time, he said. And abandonment of land may add to this decline in production.  Singh said that this is further exacerbating issues of deforestation in and around the larger cities like Dehradun and leading to water shortages.</p>
          <p> And anthropogenic activities, like the increase in tourist footfalls, can add to the warming. “Developmental activities are reaching high inner valleys. Now there are a good number of people – construction, pollution, etc, are leading to changes in local systems. They are all increasing snowmelt,” said Mal.</p>

          <p> At the elevation of over 2000 m, the villages of the Tehri district are higher than most of the region’s larger cities and wear an isolated look despite the immense footfall of tourists in the nearby Kanatal region. From the mountaintop the three peaks of Gangotri — the glacier from where the Ganga sprouts — Kedarnath and Badrinath are visible in their snow-capped, glistening might. The state received over 3 million tourists in 2022 for the Char Dham yatra as well as nature. Many of these lights you can see at night belong to small inns or hotels and homestays which have cropped out across the landscape as tourists climb higher for the views. The air is now tinged with pollution and dust as newer hotels are built and tourists come in their cars and on their motorbikes.</p>
          <p> At the turn of one such bend lies the Himalayan Kiwi Resort owned by a fruit farmer and local politician Vijender Singh Negi, a septuagenarian. With long white beard and hair, he wakes up at dawn to inspect his fruit trees and plants in his property below the hotel. He built a hut where the family began their work in the 1970s, and it remains there still — though now its rooms are filled with fertilizers or other agricultural equipment.</p>
          <p> Even though his property has over three hundred apple trees, Negi named his hotel after the kiwi fruit and calls himself a kiwi farmer. He had recently visited an international kiwi festival, which drew in farmers and enthusiasts from across the globe, and proudly shared its photos. The hotel’s lobby shows off various boxes of kiwis produced at his plantation. </p>
          <p> “While this this not [usually] the height at which kiwi is grown, due to the warming of the climate over time we can do it now,” Negi said, pointing to the various kiwi plants in his plantation. He talked excitedly of introducing the persimmon, a tomato-like orange-colored fruit from Japan. “It can tolerate a little heat,” he said, adding that the fruit is often grown at 1000 m elevation. What happens if it does not work? “Then our babughosha pears can come. If those get damaged, then we can move towards horticulture,” Negi said. </p>
          <p> After completing his education Negi returned to plant other cash crops and introduced its production across the area. But he preferred to also grow apples and other fruits and nuts, such as walnuts. Over the years, he said, the weather changed dramatically. “Today is 7th of January, and till now, there should’ve been 3 cycles of rain and two snowfalls. But none of that has happened yet,” Negi said. He has coated the ground near his apple trees’ trunks with neem to protect its moisture, which the trees need, and which is often derived from snow. But now there is little moisture in the ground to conserve. His future as a fruit farmer in the area is increasingly uncertain.  But his nephew Dheeraj Negi, an architect in his thirties, returned to Negi’s Kiwi hotel during COVID to help with agricultural work. His family lives in Dehradun, which he said is congested now. </p>
          <p> Vijender Negi said that tourism is budding, but people travel to see the greenery.  He also sees tourism to keep the younger generations in the mountains, taking care of their trees. Negi’s son Deepak also helps in managing the hotel while Dheeraj attends workshops, seminars and spends time with Negi to learn the agricultural business. However, not all families are able to afford to come back and live like their parents in the higher reaches of the Himalayas. </p>
          <p> Dr Pramod Aggarwal, South Asia Regional Program for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security said that while some of the wealthier farmers are mitigating the impacts of climate change better, most rural lower-income farmers, with smaller landholdings, may not be able to sustain themselves in the future with these changes. And it is expected that such an outflow of migrations – which is occurring in other Himalayan regions too, such as Nepal – may become higher too. </p>
          <p> And little work is being done to stop the flow of people, which have been living sustainably for generations in their farms, Singh, the ecologist, said. And it is changing the mountain culture and society as well as degrading its ecology.</p>
          <p> Mal said, “The government, society, must come together before it’s too late.” </p>

          <h2> <mark> The decline of apis cerana indica bees & the fate of Uttarakhand’s rural   communities</mark></h2>
          <section id = "break4">
            <p> When Bhavna Bisht, 37, wakes up at the crack of dawn, she sends her two children off to school in the Laksh Moli village, then goes back to her house — a new one, built with cement — cleans it, tends to her cows and small farm, and completes other household tasks. “We get busy,” Bisht said.  </p>
            <p> For the past few months, one of those tasks has been to care for the endemic bees that are living in a mud-hive at the edge of her field. She checks on them, ensures that they are not escaping or flying away, and at times, she gives them a boost of sugar-water. </p>
            <p> Bisht, who leads a group of ten women beekeepers, built the hive with the help of a local nonprofit, Appropriate Technology of India (ATI), which is hoping to keep the local bees, known as apes cerana indica, from dying out. The organization supplies the materials and trains the women on constructing the hives and maintaining them. </p>
            <p> The project began after a study revealed that the bee population in Uttarakhand was in decline. For years, the endemic bees had thrived – in part because villagers lived in mud huts, which the bees used as hives. (Bees are ectothermic, meaning they use the environment to regulate body temperature, so the mud walls help them survive changes in the climate.) </p>
            <p> But as the number of cement houses has risen – and as more villagers have moved to nearby – the bees have struggled to survive. A study from the Nainital district in the state revealed that the number of mud hut hives had fallen from more than 11 per house in 1980 to just less than 1 in 2010. And residents have largely abandoned mud-house living for more comfortable cement houses. </p>
            <p> To counter this, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development proposed a solution of building mud hives to recreate the bees’ lost habitat, and various NGOs in the region are promoting it. The hope was that the new hives would help save the bees, while also helping the local women or farmers engage in organic honey production. Because the hives are kept near fields, the bees can forage easily for nectar and pollen, while also helping to fertilize crops. Shiv Singh Rawat, who oversees the project for the ATI at this village, described the setup as a win-win solution for both the community and the environment. </p>
            <p> But when Bisht visits her field and the mud-hive nowadays, she sees dead bees strewn across.  </p>
          </section>

          <section id = "break1">
            <p> The apis cerana bees are dying out across Asia, where they are endemic, despite being used for honey production for centuries. The contributing factors leading to their decline are various: climate change, land-use changes, diseases and viruses, pests, destruction of forests, and others.  </p>
            <p> In India, where seven species of bees are endemic, the foreign European variant apis mellifera is now used for the commercial production of honey, as it tends to produce more honey. In Uttarakhand today, almost all honey is made using the mellifera, with only 15% coming from apis indica bees endemic to the Himalayan region. </p>
            <p> India is a major producer of honey, but it has come under scrutiny for exporting honey laced with chemicals or pollutants, such as antibiotics. The European Union in 2010 banned imports of Indian honey due to the contamination. </p>
            <p> Honey produced using revised indigenous methods can help make it organic, and thus less prone to contamination and import bans, said Ripu Singh, an ecologist working with the same non-profit on the project in Himachal Pradesh. </p>
            <p> “Usually, commercial honey is contaminated by chemicals and pesticides. We try to motivate farmers towards organic farming, which is not an easy task,” said Singh. </p>
            <p> ATI’s work in introducing and promoting mud-hives for honey production began in 1994 and is spread across six districts in Uttarakhand and the neighboring state of Himachal Pradesh. Being cheaper to produce and maintain than hives made of wood, the mud-hives are popular with small-scale farmers. ATI also helps in facilitating the farmers’ access to the market. </p>
            <p> One such farmer is Mahendra Prasad Bhatt of Sirmour in Himachal Pradesh, who has tended to a mud-hive for two years. It’s kept next to his field where he grows mustard, vegetables, and other crops. Bhatt said that he has taken out honey from it four times, extracting around 4 kilograms each time, with each kilo selling for Rs 600-700. It is a modest income. “[But] The oil from the mustard seeds [also] comes out better now,” he said, adding that he is seeing fewer pest infections because of the hive’s presence. </p>
          </section>
          <p class = "break"> *** </p>
          <section id = "break2">
            <p> The state of Uttarakhand draws religious tourists and pilgrims to its holy sites, such as the Gangotri glacier, from which the holy Ganga emerges, and scenic wonders, like the Kedarnath and the Badrinath peaks. In 2022, the state saw some 3.3 million visitors. </p>
            <p> That influx has driven a construction boom, with newer highways, rail lines, houses and hotels cropping up across the state. </p>
            <p>  This has led to deforestation and cutting down of mountains even if landslides are prominent. Near Laksh Moli, the railways are building a tunnel and line to add connectivity to various cities via rail for the Rishikesh-Karnaprayag New Line, and it is being done by L&T Company and Nav Yuga. The construction work is intense, and Bisht said that at times the villagers are sometimes unable to distinguish between an earthquake and the construction work. </p>
            <p> The environmental effects have been severe. The construction company tunneling through the mountain regularly dumps construction waste near Bisht’s village. In January, the dust and exhaust from the construction created a thick haze that permeated the air, even coating the leaves. In the same month of January, in the town of Joshimath, home to the religious pilgrimage site of Badrinath, over 20,000 people had to be evacuated after the town collapsed into an enormous sinkhole caused by overpopulation and excessive infrastructure.  </p>
            <p> When Rawat visited Bisht and the other beekeepers in Laksh Moli village a few days later, they were furious. Sumitra Devi, 50, said that her mustard crops were getting ruined due to the pollution, and that people were developing respiratory illnesses and her cows were dying. </p>
            <p> Bisht agreed. “The air is filled with dust and debris. People are getting allergies,” she said. The bees, she added, were also suffering. “Every day, five to six bees are dying. Their wings are laden with dust. The flowers and plants are laden with dust,” she said. </p>
            <p> Air pollution can impact the survival rate of bees and is another factor in their steady decline. Bees exposed to higher levels of pollution also showed metal contamination in their wings and bodies, and impaired memory and olfactory abilities, as per studies. </p>
            <p> “We don’t know how long we can tolerate it,” Bisht said. Other people in the meeting vociferously complained the same. </p>
          </section>
          <p class = "break"> *** </p>
          <section id = "break3">
            <p> But the central & state governments, both BJP, show no signs of stopping. In March 2023, the central government announced over 6 large infrastructural projects in the region bordering China. But after Joshimath, and the dislocation of people post Tehri dam construction, the locals are wary of such aggrandizing schemes. </p>
            <p> In March, Bisht said that they were seriously contemplating leaving the village and migrating elsewhere. At the January meeting, Bisht commented that fully populated villages in the state were now declining.  Bisht said that she has lost the incentive to work. “We do not leave the land fallow. But, now, we do not feel like farming, as the wild boars and monkeys destroy our crops. The government doesn’t pay any attention.” Bisht said. </p>
            <p>  “There are villages in some districts that are ghost villages, or have largely elderly people left,” Ripu Singh said. In 2021, it was revealed in an RTI that out-migration from mountains to other areas grew exponentially, with over 300,000 people leaving. It has led to over 700 ghost villages in the state.  </p>
            <p> Singh said that beekeeping can motivate women to stay back. “The forest will degrade without human intervention and agriculture, and invasive species will also become an issue,” Singh said. Experts say that forest creeping back into these former fields leads to degradation. </p>
            <p> Negi, the former village leader said, “There is no migration from our village. But in the coming years, there will be an outflow of people from the village. That is for certain.”  </p>
